Before you make a Discord Bot, you should have a good understanding of JavaScript. This means you should have a basic understanding of the following topics:

- Read and understand docs
- Debug code
- Syntax
- NodeJS module system

If you aren't sure that your understanding of JavaScript is truly good enough to make a bot, you should really try to continue learning first. Here are good resources to learn both Javascript and NodeJS:

_Codecademy_: <https://www.codecademy.com/learn/javascript>
_Udemy_: <https://www.udemy.com/javascript-essentials/>
_Eloquent JavaScript, free book_: http://eloquentjavascript.net/
_You-Dont-Know-JS_: <https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS>
_JavaScript Garden_: <https://bonsaiden.github.io/JavaScript-Garden/>
_JavaScript reference/docs_: <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference>
_Nodeschool_: <https://nodeschool.io/>
_Pluralsight_: <https://www.codeschool.com/courses/real-time-web-with-node-js>

Before you ask a question, you should ask these yourself:
**1)** Is this question related to JavaScript, or the library I am using? - If it is the library you are using, go to the proper server. You would get better answers there.
**2)** Have I tried to google and / or check StackOverflow? - Double check that you can't find anywhere that can lead you to a solution online.
**3)** Have I tried to look on MDN or the library documentation? - You should always check documentations to make sure you aren't missing how any details.
**4)** Does my question make enough sense so that people can understand it, and do they understand what I am trying to accomplish? - If no, revise your question. Give as much detail as possible. Include any error or code output that can help us help you.
**5)** Am I aware of what I am doing, and not just mindlessly copy and pasting? - If you are just copy and pasting code from a guide, you are not going to be able to solve anything. Make sure you understand the code you are writing.

Add `--legacy-peer-deps` to your npm install command (every time) or run `npm config --global set legacy-peer-deps=true` just once to globally configure this same option.
